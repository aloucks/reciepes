# Beef Chuck Pot Roast

### Ingredients

- 4 lbs Beef Chuck Roast
- 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter
- 1 tbsp Vegetable Oil
- 1 large Yellow Onion (cut into large wedges)
- 2 cloves Garlic (or 1 tbs Garlic Powder)
- 6 Carrots
- 2 Celery Stalks
- 4 Potatoes (cut into large pieces)
- 2 tsp Rosemary
- 2 Bay Leaves
- 6 oz Tomato Paste
- 1 cups Red Wine
- 2 cups Beef Broth
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Season beef with salt and pepper.
2. In a large dutch oven, place the butter and vegetable oil over medium high heat. Once butter is melted, add seasoned beef and sear until golden brown on all sides. Remove to a plate and set aside.
3. Toss together onion, garlic, carrots, celery, potatoes, rosemary in the pan. Allow to cook, stirring occasionally, until browned. Stir in tomato paste and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes.
4. Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping up the brown bits form the bottom of the pan, and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes.
5. Place the seared beef back in the pan and top with beef stock and add bay leaves.
6. Cover and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook until the beef is tender and shreds easily, about 4 hours or until internal temperature is about 200 degrees F. Season with more salt and pepper if needed. Remove the bay leaves before serving.
