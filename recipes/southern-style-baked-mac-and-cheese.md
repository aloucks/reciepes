# Southern Style Baked Mac and Cheese

### Ingredients

- 1/2 lbs sharp cheddar, shredded
- 1/2 lbs colby jack, shredded
- 1/2 lbs american cheese, shredded
- 1 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 lbs macaroni
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 2 x 12oz cans evaporated milk
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 3/4 
- 1 stick unsalted butter, melted

### Notes

- salted butter isn't too salty
- 1 x 12 oz sharp cheddar and 1 x 12 oz colby, because it's easier

### Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 375F. Cook macaroni in salted water per package instructions until al dente. Drain water and add noodles to a large bowl.
2. Mix all cheeses together into a separate bowl.
3. In another separate bowl, make the egg custard by whisking together 3 large eggs, sour cream, evaporated milk, salt and pepper.
4. Add egg custard, melted butter, and about 85%-90% of the shredded cheese blend into the large bowl with the cooked macaroni. Stir. Mixture will be runny.
5. Pour mixture into 9" x 13" baking disk, smooth down the top, and top with reserved shredded cheese. Bake at 375 F for 35-40 minutes until cheese on top is golden and melted.
